Project Overview

You are developing a WordPress plugin that captures and saves Contact Form 7 (CF7) form submissions into a database. The plugin should:
â€¢ Hook into CF7 form submission events.
â€¢ Store form data in a custom database table.
â€¢ Provide an admin interface using jQuery, and TailwindCSS to view saved submissions.

1. Set Up the Plugin Structure:
   Take current plugin and folder structure and necessary files.
   Use PSR-4 autoloading if needed.
   Follow WordPress plugin development best practices.

2. Build an Admin Page for Viewing Submissions:
   Already have a admin page for submissions. Refactor it to use to meet the requirements.
   â€¢ Add a custom menu in the WordPress admin panel.
   â€¢ Fetch saved submissions and display them in a table.
   â€¢ Implement pagination if needed.

3. Ensure Security & Performance
   â€¢ Use prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.
   â€¢ Sanitize and validate inputs before saving to the database.
   â€¢ Optimize database queries to prevent performance bottlenecks.

4. List of issues found

4.1 Internationalization: Text domain does not match plugin slug.

In order to make a string translatable in your plugin you are using a set of special functions. These functions collectively are known as "gettext".

These functions have a parameter called "text domain", which is a unique identifier for retrieving translated strings.

This "text domain" must be the same as your plugin slug so that the plugin can be translated by the community using the tools provided by the directory. As for example, if this plugin slug is "cf7-to-db" the Internationalization functions should look like:
esc_html\_\_('Hello', 'cf7-to-db');

From your plugin, you have set your text domain as follows:

# This plugin is using the domain "cf7-save-to-db" for 23 element(s).

However, the current plugin slug is this:
cf7-to-db

4.2 Nonces and User Permissions Needed for Security

Please add a nonce check to your input calls ($\_POST, $\_GET, $REQUEST) to prevent unauthorized access.

If you use wp*ajax* to trigger submission checks, remember they also need a nonce check.

ðŸ‘® Checking permissions: Keep in mind, a nonce check alone is not bulletproof security. Do not rely on nonces for authorization purposes. When needed, use it together with current_user_can() in order to prevent users without the right permissions from accessing things they shouldn't.

Also make sure that the nonce logic is correct by making sure it cannot be bypassed. Checking the nonce with current_user_can() is great, but mixing it with other checks can make the condition more complex and, without realising it, bypassable, remember that anything can be sent through an input, don't trust any input.

Keep performance in mind. Don't check for post submission outside of functions. Doing so means that the check will run on every single load of the plugin, which means that every single person who views any page on a site using your plugin will be checking for a submission. This will make your code slow and unwieldy for users on any high traffic site, leading to instability and eventually crashes.
